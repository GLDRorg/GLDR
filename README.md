GLDR
====

GLDR stands for (Open)GL Done Right.

This is low level library focused on bringing OpenGL into the modern C++ world. It will be focused on provideing a focused set of utility classes that will extened the work done by glload to provide modern C++ semantics.

GLDR will not provide any sort of context handling, and will be assuming the you have already initialised glload. It is aiming to be as 'header only' as possible, and this fits well with the scope of this project. You will not find any complex 3D animation classes here or even image loading classes; at least, not to start with.

This project was spawned on the back a few people getting just a little bit fed up with all reworking the same basic utility classes in isolation, by coming together we aim to provided a library that you just cannot work without. We will be striving to make the code the very best it can be, aiming for that perfect balance between ease of use and flexibility. This will mean that, especially during the early stages, if we have to change more or less everything to improve it, we will. Backwards compatibility is not going to hold us back, like it has OpenGl itself. So please do jump on board and make use of GLDR, but be prepared to make drastic change to your code if you want to keep up with us.
